<header>PANdummyC: A not so typical short love story of a dummy account during pandemic</header><br />
<i>by dKt3k</i><br />
<br />
‘Wondering what I did during the past few months since the pandemic had started,’ these were the
exact words which were going around Mighuel’s mind. Mighuel is studying at Ateneo de Davao
University (AdDU) taking up Bachelor of Science in Nursing. He's one of those students who
thinks that online class was of no use. However, he didn’t want to be left behind, that’s why
regardless of that fact— he still enrolled for an online class.<br />
<br />
‘BABby, I wrote you a song,’ Kwinzy said while he was calling Mighuel with their endearment, later
that evening when she was busy doing her modules and at the same time talking to Mighuel— what
is multitasking? Kwinzy is a Bachelor of Science in Medical Technology student and this degree
serves as a pre medical course for her to become a doctor. She’s studying at Lyceum of the
Philippines Davao (LPU). With the notion of invalidation, she started thinking if all of these were
real— specifically, is Mighuel a real person? Does he even exist in real life?<br />
<br />
At first, it was all just fun and games. Mighuel, a 19-year-old boy, didn't know what to do during
his free times. He was kind of like lightning and speed combined when doing his assigned tasks on
Google classroom. With that in mind, he decided to stay hidden and soon made an account (for
fun) to be able to converse with anyone without them knowing his real identity— and then his
dummy world existed. He first joined a gaming group that interests him. From voice calling (No
video calling for it defeats the purpose of his so-called ‘dummy’ life) to sharing the basic facts about
his personal life to anyone that he considered his friend. I mean, during this pandemic and of course
an online class that should’ve not taken place at this period of time, what more could he do? He
was bored and because he was an expert when it comes to technology and stuff he wanted his life
to perhaps become interesting. Because of this inexplicable event, he met a lot of new people on
screen and gathered his own kind of circle which he reckon as the kind of friendship he never had
in his real life. For him, it was exceptional.<br />
<br />
“...<i>We have the same taste, same vibes.<br />
Talking to you feels one of a kind,<br />
There’s no dull moment,<br />
But I’m still tryna forget”</i>— SSNHB by Kwinzy<br />
<br />
Kwinzy wrote that song for Mighuel because she believes that they have a lot in common. Cheesy
as it may sound but just like Mavis and Jonathan in Hotel Transylvania, they ‘zinged’.<br />
<br />
They still haven’t known each other for a long period of time. But with that short amount of
opportunity that has been given, they know a lot of things about each other’s life. From telling each
other how their day was. Or simply say things that would make them feel less stressed out because
of their online class— for a moment in time, they simply got each other’s back. Kwinzy, an 18-
year-old girl living in a small town was slowly breaking down her walls for Mighuel, who was indeed
a ‘go-with-the-flow’ kind of guy. She expected less than what she could think of about Mighuel.
Although she was slightly unsure of her feelings about Mighuel, she still wants to be assured if
Mighuel truly exists and is not merely a ghost who would want to appear and disappear whenever
he feels like he needs to. However, despite all of that feeling of uncertainties, Kwinzy decided to
continue what they both started.<br />
<br />
<i>“Pasensya ka na’t minahal kita, Ngunit<br />
‘di puwede may nauna pala.<br />
Mahal, ako’y hindi mawawala saiyo<br />
Kahit hindi ako ang pinili mo’’</i>— ILAAM by Mighuel<br />
<br />
Mighuel started singing his own composition of song while on call; dedicated to his special friend,
Kwinzy. Kwinzy, a dumbfounded person, turned out feeling more confused as what she was feeling
when she started having feelings for Mighuel. Her heart feels like sitting on a cloud nine but has
cumulus nimbus. In short, she feels loved but at the same time she didn’t want to go there yet
because first of all, Mighuel knows Kwinzy by her real identity because she was on a main account.
On the other hand, Kwinzy didn’t know Mighuel’s main and the reason why he was on a dummy
account. ‘What is he really up to? Did he just plan to break my heart without a short notice?’ Not
Kwinzy talking with herself. Because clearly, she was losing her mind.<br />
<br />
It’s not always rainbows and butterflies, Mighuel started losing interest in everything. Including his
life in a dummy world. He doesn't blame himself for not planning to pursue Kwinzy because to top
it all, Kwinzy is in an open relationship with someone. Mighuel didn’t want to be an option. ‘Always
been the second best, now it’s time to rest,’ Mighuel blurted out the words and ended the call
between him and Kwinzy. Kwinzy, feeling numb, felt that her world literally turned upside down
after hearing the last words of her beloved. She didn’t expect that losing Mighuel was as fast as how
they ended up talking and knowing each other in the first place. She laughs with her foolishness
but later on cries in despair. She has a lot of questions left unanswered and she knows that it will
remain that way for Mighuel is drifting away. Because of that she cried herself to sleep and woke
up early in the morning feeling empty.<br />
<br />
<i>“Gurl, ‘wag ka na umasa. Nasa dummy account ‘yon”<br />
“Bebe gorl, ‘wag kang bonak (b*ang na sh*ngak)”<br />
“Just focus on your open relationship with Leonardrio, magkaka-label rin naman kayo soon. Cheer up bhie!”</i><br />
<br />
These are some statements that came from Kwinzy’s best friends after knowing what happened
between her and Mighuel’s situation. She was desperate about knowing Mighuel’s real account to
the point that she was digging and making some sort of investigations with the help of her and
Mighuel’s common friends. However, she failed. Because Mighuel is an intellect, no one could
outsmart him when it comes to technologies and stuff like that. To finally say his good bye, Mighuel
concluded the thing between him and Kwinzy and chatted her through hangouts on email. He just
left the link for Kwinzy to hear the song ‘Tuloy Pa Rin by Neocolours’ on YouTube. He was smiling
foolishly the whole time he was listening to the song before he sent the link to Kwinzy. He
remembered how they used to communicate with Kwinzy with song lyrics:“Just focus on your open relationship with Leonardrio, magkaka-label rin naman kayo soon. Cheer up bhie!”</i><br />

foolishly the whole time he was listening to the song before he sent the link to Kwinzy. He
remembered how they used to communicate with Kwinzy with song lyrics:<br />
<br />
<i>-On messenger chat-<br />
Mighuel: *sends a link about a song* ‘Kung Ako Nalang Sana by Bituin Escalante’<br />
Kwinzy: *also replies with a link of a song* ‘Mahal Kita Pero by Janella Salvador’<br />
Mighuel: *replies with a link* ‘Tayo Nalang Dalawa by Mayonnaise’<br />
Kwinzy: *rebuts with a link on a Tiktok Video* “OH? Tingin Tingin Mo Diyan? Gusto Mo? Luh, Asa ka!
challenge”</i><br />
<br />
Memories keep flashing back on Mighuel’s head starting from their first conversation about
Mighuel asking Kwinzy if they could party (invitation to a game). It was a tough ride, he can’t say
that he didn’t enjoy it, because he had fun. However, he doesn't want to go and take that ride ever
again. For him it was kind of like a bar down business. He invested his feelings when he already
knew he had the 100% chance of losing for taking the risk; because Kwinzy had someone before
him (she’s with an open relationship). And she also told Mighuel that Leonardrio’s a good guy.<br />
<br />
Mighuel already knew at that point of time when Kwinzy was sharing about someone who she has
an open relationship with— Leonardrio, is a kind guy and is more deserving for Kwinzy. Because
based on what Kwinzy telling Mighuel, she said that Leonardrio is so focused to the point that they
hardly chat or talk about everything or things that didn’t even made sense— the guy was serious
about his academic life, and wanted to work everything out in order to prove to Kwinzy that he is
worth of her parent’s approval and that he needed time in order to pursue Kwinzy and make their
relationship official and exclusive. Hearing all of that made Mighuel re-evaluate himself. He was
far from Leonardrio. That is why he decided to not put up an effort of revealing his real self (giving
out his main account) to Kwinzy. ‘What’s the use of showing Kwinzy the real me when I’m not
planning to steal her away from Leonardrio,’ Mighuel said while talking to his friends online.
Mighuel’s friends support what he was doing for it was kind of the right thing to do. Because what
if Mighuel really did expose himself to Kwinzy, what will happen to Leonardrio? He didn’t want
to sound arrogant but Mighuel already thought of the possible things that could happen— Kwinzy
telling Leonardrio that they should stop. And Mighuel didn’t want that.<br />
<br />
By then, Mighuel realized that he’s too young and he should be focusing more about the social
happenings around the world. Also, Mighuel has been enlightened as to why it was essential to have
an online class. ‘It was not really a bad thing after all (pertaining to online class)’, Mighuel said while
deleting his dummy account and continuing on delving deeper about the social crisis that the world
is currently facing. He now knows what he wants in life. He reads news about the pandemic so that
he would become knowledgeable about it. He was empathetic about hearing all the news regarding
Covid19. But he also would like to emphasize that we, people have to be cautious and at the same
time conscientious, let us follow what the authorities have told us to do so for we are living in a
one society— in a one country. If we just appreciate all the efforts of the administration and be a
responsible citizen for us to become safe, then there will be no problem. Beyond everything, they
think that it is beneficial (their laws, pros, and cons during pandemic) for us. Therefore, we should
also think of it that way and not the other way around. The world is full of chaos, let us not be the
one to make it more chaotic.<br />
<br />
Currently, Mighuel is living his life to the fullest and is now focusing on his one and only main
account. Taking away all of his negative traits and bad habits— he regretted making a dummy
account during pandemic. He has a lot in plate but he still manages to create his second world on
the screen considering the fact that there was an emerging social crisis— the pandemic. But the
good news is, all is well now. It is now the year 2070 and the Filipinos were resilient. The Covid19
was gone because a young Filipino Scientist was able to find the cure and made a vaccine that
helped each and every one who have acquired the virus around the world. ‘It was not nice after all.
Not because you’re bored and have nothing to do with life, you should take advantage of your
capability to do unruly things’, Mighuel told his grandchildren. He educated his two grandsons
about how to become a media literate individual and taught them how to use the internet wisely.
Also, Mighuel shared about his experiences in the year 2019-2020 where Coronavirus 2019 took
place.<br />
<br />
‘DaddyLo, how about Kwinzy? Did you ever have the chance to meet her again and not introduce
yourself as someone who you’re not?’, Gowan asked with full curiosity. Mighuel didn’t expect that
kind of question coming from his 7-year-old grandson. He then smiled sheepishly and said, ‘Well,
I didn’t... I didn’t let the opportunity pass’. His two grandsons were really confused because of
Mighuel’s answer. With a serious face, Deino, his 5-year-old grandson, who was the exact copy of
Mighuel’s face told Mighuel a follow up question, ‘You can’t just leave us hanging, you said you
had changed. Why do we feel like we’ve been KwinzyZoned?’ Deino annoyingly asked. ‘BABby,
what are the things have you been telling our two grandsons again?’, Kwinzy (her ign) walked in
with a handful of snacks in their backyard garden. Mighuel answered: ‘Nothing babe, it’s just me’.<br />
<br />
He stood up on his classic rocking chair and gently held Kwinzy’s hand and placed his hands
around Kwinzy’s waist. They swayed to the rhythm of the music “<i>Baliw</i> by SUD”. Deino felt
disgusted while watching because he was not a fan of sweet moments. On the other hand, Gowan
was dancing along with his DaddyLo and MommyLa.
<br />
<i>“Sa’yo lang nabaliw, Sa’yo<br />
lang nagkaganito.<br />
Sa’yo lang naramdaman ng puso ko<br />
Lahat, sa’yo”</i>— Baliw by SUD<br />
<br />
Mighuel was singing along to the song while slow dancing with the love of his life, Kwinzy. They
were just staring at each other’s eyes with full of adoration. ‘Through pandemic to PANdummyC.
But now, I just want you to know how grateful I am because you are the love of my life who I
always seek.’ Mighuel told Kwinzy.<br />
