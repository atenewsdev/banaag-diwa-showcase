<header>A PROBLEM OF BEES</header><br />
<i>by Jean Sin</i><br />
<br />
It was no longer possible to recall how many times you were asked to write this story. Nor was it
deemed necessary to ascertain that this story was really yours in the first place. All you had known
since the beginning was that you woke up one day with a single memory in your head.<br />
<br />
This version of your story begins with a flaming, sky-bare morning in June. The weather forecast
was wrong. Again. But oh, well. Your skin had already acquainted itself with the fever of a
Philippine sun in full blaze. Unsurprisingly, you remained unbothered by the fact that you were
still in bed burying yourself under the awkward refuge of a fuzzy blanket.<br />
<br />
The heat was not the problem, that’s for sure. It was the strange buzzing sound in your ears that
countered every attempt to return to the pleasure of dreams. By then, a hive of thoughts came
swarming into your mind:
<br /><br />
<center><i>
I'm sick of this place.<br />
The electric fan is malfunctioning again.<br />
What's it like to live in the Kabisera?<br />
I should just buy a new one.<br />
What the heck is that weird buzzing noise?<br />
Do they have aircons there?<br />
I'm sick of this place.<br />
</center></i>
<br />
You were about to bury your head deeper into the pillow when echoes of a familiar voice suddenly
invaded the room. “Jusko! Please tell me you’re awake!”<br />
<br />
You sat up in frantic response to your wife’s relentless hollering. Lamenting the weight, you rolled
yourself out of bed and scratched the burning brightness of the day from your eyes. The buzzing
went on. “Honey, I think...Can we get that fan fixed?”<br />
<br />
“What? You’re mumbling again! Do you have any regard for time? Sir Bisu is already on his way.”<br />
<br />
“Sir Bisu?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Sir Bisu. Our landlord? He’s stopping by for lunch. Haven’t I told you? Fix that face of
yours, please, you look like a zombie.”<br />
<br />
“Haven’t we given him this month’s rent? Now that glutton wants our food? I bet I could fit a
whole fridge in that man’s stomach.”<br />
<br />
“Someone’s a little groggy today. It’s too late, dear. You better get dressed or it’s boiled okra for
you.”<br />
<br />
Hesitant, you got up and dragged your feet toward the bathroom sink to wash away any mark of
sleeplessness. Out of all the tenants’ residences, yours was the only one with two toilet spaces: one
near the kitchen and another inside the convenience of your bedroom. You smiled proudly at the
rusted mirror. The buzzing had thankfully stopped yet your wife begun to hum some unusual
tunes in the next room.<br />
<br />
Peering through the door, you noticed how your wife was dressed ridiculously fancy that day. She
had on a yellow laced blouse once owned by her mother, a black striped skirt which had been a
wedding gift, and a pair of gigantic pearl earrings which she must have bought somewhere in
Chinatown. There was an odd glow to this woman, you thought.<br />
<br />
“How did you end up marrying me again?”<br />
<br />
“Hush! Sir Bisu is already by the corridor. I’m still setting the table. Let him in, will you?”<br />
<br />
Surely enough, Sir Bisu was already lingering by the front window. It was impossible not to miss
his presence. He cast a gigantic silhouette behind the curtains and not even the thick cemented
walls of your apartment room could ease his gruff voice: “Ayooooo!”<br />
<br />
You opened the door and stretched out a solemn smile.<br />
<br />
“Ah! Good to see my old pare. Is Misis home?”<br />
<br />
“Good to see you too, boss!”<br />
<br />
Your wife ran out of the kitchen to greet the guest. “I’m glad you stopped by for lunch, Sir. Come
in. Make yourself home.”<br />
<br />
“Well, honey, technically this is his home.”<br />
<br />
“I hope I’m not imposing,” the old Sir interrupted. “Oh! Is that vegetable stew?”<br />
<br />
“You have an awfully good sense of smell!” your wife said cheerfully.<br />
<br />
As you were about to close the door behind you, your wife bumped her elbow on your arm. “Be
good and take his coat.”<br />
<br />
You took to the task and helped Sir Bisu who labored to take his thick coat off. You wondered
why anyone would walk around Subalteria, a foothill town, wearing something unfit for the harsh,
arid weather. There had always been a few things about fashion and functionality you found
difficult to reconcile. Perhaps it was a matter better understood by those who lived in the high
regions of Kabisera. If the weather forecast was not wrong that day, it would have been so easy
for the visitor to make a spectacle of himself.<br />
<br />
Unintentionally, you noticed there was a seal attached to the breast pocket of Sir Bisu’s coat. It
was the image of a wild boar resting under the shadow a lion, which marked that he was an
honorary citizen of the of Kabisera despite his rumored Subalteria origins. If he was not so broad,
he would have looked so handsomely tall in it. You were about to slide your arm into one of its
sleeves when your wife called you to the table.<br />
<br />
The three of you sat stiffly in the dimly lit dining room, with your gaze steadying toward Sir Bisu.
Though you found his paced breathing bothersome, even obscene, you confessed to yourself that
he was indeed a naturally charismatic man. Yet not even his vibrant, neighborly demeanor could
hide the years buried beneath his wrinkles.<br />
<br />
Sir Bisu pulled out a handkerchief and wiped the sweat on his forehead.<br />
<br />
“Must be quite the heat for you, Sir. Too bad we don’t have your air-cooling gizmos.”<br />
<br />
Sir Bisu lowered his voice. “No, no. It’s fine. Anyway, you both know that I am on my way back
to the Kabisera, right? I remember informing you previously that I was called to stay there for a
short while. Business matters.”<br />
<br />
You and your wife looked at each other. “We thought you had gone already,” you replied.<br />
<br />
“Well, some plans got delayed. But I am going on my way there today to deliver the results of the
lottery.”<br />
<br />
Having heard this, your foot begun to fidget violently under the table. Sir Bisu simply nodded his
head to your wife.<br />
<br />
“Ma’am, I trust that you already know that your husband has been testing the tides of fate. He
has—”.<br />
<br />
“Wait, what?” Your wife quickly locked her eyes on you then on the poor, sweaty Sir Bisu. “Do
you mean...”<br />
<br />
“Ah, how should I put it? Has he not told you yet? I had hoped you were very honest with each
other considering—”<br />
<br />
<i>What the heck is wrong with this man, you thought.</i><br />
<br />
Your wife looked at you with her lips crunching. “Well, are you going to say something?”<br />
<br />
There was a long period of silence. Then the buzzing sound suddenly returned. It was not your
plan to expose yourself that day but the noise in your head was growing too strong. What came
out was a thick, regretful flurry of words:<br />
<br />
<center><i>
“I can explain...<br />
Yeah, I guess I tried it out.<br />
Probably bought a ticket or two.<br />
But I’m sure I still have one last entry.<br />
I’m quite confident about it.<br />
Can you imagine if we won?<br />
We’ll be out of here in no time. In the Kabisera!<br />
Dream big every once in a while, will you?<br />
I was going to tell you.<br />
I knew you’d react this way.<br />
I was planning to—"<br />
</center></i>
<br />
“Kill yourself?! And what if you don’t win? Is your head broken? Have you forgotten that everyone
who loses to the lottery becomes a bondslave to the Kabisera. You think you’d fare better there
as a servant than here as my husband? Jusko, I can’t believe you were willing to put the price of a
lottery ticket above the price of your own free will!”<br />
<br />
You sat in raw shock and amazement. This was perhaps the first time your wife had spoken of
matters concerning slavery and freedom, not that they did not matter to you personally nor were
they intellectually inaccessible. Somehow, the conversations you shared in between meals were
always confined to This Month’s Rent, Water Bills, and Job Vacancies. Anything beyond, you
believed, was a privilege of time and discernment—an opportunity one had to find ways to afford.<br />
<br />
“Hold on, hold on,” Sir Bisu interrupted. “I did not mean for you to fight. This was why I called
you in the first place, why I’ve come here today.” Sir Bisu struggled to reach inside his right pocket.<br />
<br />
“I have something that may lift your spirits. You see, the winning number is in this folded piece
of paper.”<br />
<br />
You saw your wife straighten her back and ease her crinkled face. By this time, Sir Bisu was already
grinning from ear to ear. “Lean in and listen carefully to my instructions. Once you open this, be
careful to remember the code. Don’t throw this away without memorizing it. This is your future.
Pay attention, pay attention. You don’t want to mess this up.” Again, he wiped the sweat on his
forehead.<br />
<br />
“When you’re confident that you’ve memorized the code, burn this immediately. Leave no trace.
I will reach the Kabisera in three days. If you drop your entry before I arrive there, there’s a good
chance you will win. And do not mention this to anyone. Unless you want to kill yourself, of
course.”<br />
<br />
"Why couldn't you just tell me directly, sir? It's just the three of us here. It's not like the whole
world is listening," you said mockingly.<br />
<br />
"Hay, hijo. You are not as bright as I thought you were. Anyone can hear our voices. No one can
ever record our thoughts."<br />
<br />
“You mean to say someone is watching you right now?’<br />
<br />
"Us, hijo. Let’s just say I am under special protection. The Kabisera has many enemies here in
Subalteria. The lottery is a vital pillar of that city because it is tradition. And you know tradition.
Break it and the whole thing collapses."<br />
<br />
Sir Bisu stopped to catch his breath. "Delivering this small...simple code may seem...no chore
but it’s a dangerous task. Would you take the responsibility...if I asked you?"<br />
<br />
You remained silent.<br />
<br />
“Right. You’re troubled by trivial things. But don’t worry, my good friend. Once I reach the
borders, there will be no need for fancy protocol like this."<br />
<br />
You lifted an eyebrow. "How sure are you that you can trust us?"<br />
<br />
“The lot of you here are just like bees. Some you can call pests but some are quite useful for work.
Still, there are those who stake their entire lives on a single sting. They are the weakest of the
species."<br />
<br />
“You mean the rebels, sir?”<br />
<br />
A thin fly landed on your plate. At that moment, you realized that none of you have touched your
food. Your wife was incredibly silent.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I already know which of you is which.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I’ll leave you now. Remember, enter that number before three days pass and perhaps
we’ll see each other in the Kabisera.”<br />
<br />
Sir Bisu rose from his chair and you followed to escort him to the door. As soon as Sir Bisu stepped
outside, he took your arm and whispered in your ear: “Do you ever stop to wonder how much
you really know about the world?”<br />
<br />
Then he turned his back and left without giving you a chance to respond. You did not understand
what those words meant until later. What a strange, strange man, you thought.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Sir Bisu’s note sat still on the wooden table. There was nothing impressive about the
fact that it was written on tissue. Yet from afar, it appeared like a lotus floating in the middle of a
muddy river, awaiting a lonely pilgrim from afar to lend some sort of grand revelation, only that
there was nothing romantic about the whole scenario. You marveled that the possibility of a new
life, of redemption, was held inside the indecency of this sorry sheet of toilet paper. Life is a joke,
you laughed to yourself. You looked at your wife once more to see if she wanted to say anything.
With a limp arm, she simply motioned for you to go ahead and open it.<br />
<br />
You picked it up with trembling hands and slowly, you unfolded the paper. It read:<br />
<br />
<center><i>
Out of the eater, something to eat.
Out of the strong, something sweet.
</center></i>
<br />
You shook your head. <i>I don’t understand.</i><br />
Your wife leaned closer to you. “Well? Don’t just stare at it. What does it say?”<br />
“It’s not a number. It looks like some kind of riddle.” <i>What a strange, strange man,</i> you thought.<br />
“Give me that!” Your wife took the note swiftly from your hands. “This can’t be.”<br />
“Why? What do you mean? Can you solve it?’<br />
Her eyes begun to glisten with anger. “This can’t be.”<br />
<br />
<center><i>
***
</center></i>
You can no longer remember how it came about but you were convinced that those were your
wife’s final words. You had not heard from her ever since. It has been suggested countless of times
that she must have left that very day.<br />
<br />
As for the buoyant Sir Bisu, he did not visit you again. The last time you saw him, he was on
national TV. He had been granted a high position in the Kabisera after capturing some thirty
rebels. At least, that is what the news programs repeatedly declared.<br />
<br />
You have been told that a few months after, you mustered the strength to rummage through your
wife’s belongings. Perhaps by doing so, you would find some kind of souvenir: an old photograph,
a pair of pearl earrings, or a crumpled sheet of paper. Anything to conjure up a new memory and
thus save yourself from the dread of her absence. You had not touched her side of the bed since
her disappearance.<br />
<br />
All you can remember, and perhaps this is where the story really begins, was taking her pillow and
curling your arms around it when you heard a loud, muffled sound beneath its covers.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, or desperation, you grabbed a sharp pencil from the bedside table and slashed
through its cotton skin. You could not forget what you saw after:<br />
<br />
Inside was a mass of dead bees, their bodies broken in sunder, as well as a small Bible with a paper
bookmark that led to the book of Judges. On the margins, a few notes were written:<br /><br />
<center><i>
Long live the free Subalteria dream<br />
blood is our milk, flowing in streams<br />
upon the Kabisera, judgment shall pass<br />
while our children drink honey from the lion’s carcass.<br />
</center></i>
<br />
