<header>A Remnant of War</header><br />

<br />
I went home that day March 15 thinking I could ride a bus next week to go back to the city. Little
did I know that that trip would change my life, literally and figuratively. I am Athena, and I am a
remnant of war.<br />
<br />
Everything was fine, my friends and I ate at every restaurant and partied on clubs. We danced and
screamed on top of our lungs as if every day was the last day of our lives. To me, this was an
escape, I grew up with parents who overly protects me even to the point of almost controlling my
decisions. When I came to the city and when I met people who are different in their own ways, I
fell in love with the thousand possibilities of finding myself.<br />
<br />
As my name implies, I am wise. I was never a slave of love, I could see clearly through men and
their intentions, except one. When it came to friends, I could feel if they’re being fake or real by
just hugging them, except one. I am not a bad girl. It may seem so because most people think I
am being irresponsible with my academics but hey, here is my report card and they’re all A’s.<br />
<br />
But behind all these that you know about me, there are dark pages of my life that I keep a secret
because even I am not at peace with them. When every news station in the country was blaring
about a flu-like disease which originated in China that spreads through respiratory droplets from
coughing and sneezing. People began to panic. The government began to uhm, reason why the
airports were not yet closed, but anyway lockdowns were implemented, and travel restrictions were
imposed, although quite late but they were eventually. The transmission of this virus was rapid,
one infected person in a room could infect all the others in less than two hours.<br />
<br />
Less people went out and all the fun were banned. Drinking was not allowed, mass gatherings
were restricted, and mass testing were also not approved which was quite funny. Everyone was
told to stay at home. And that’s when it hit me, where is home?<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I took that life-changing bus ride. I arrived at this place I grew up in, I ate my mom’s
special <i>tinolang manok</i>, and I slowly felt my lungs become tight. It was so hard to breathe. It was
suffocating to be here again, but I know this would be over and I can ride my escape bus back to
the city in no time. My room window was overlooking a lake, and even that did not seem as lovely
as it used to be. The first month of being stuck in this place was exciting, even if I liked to work
on my school projects it actually felt good to be free from academic responsibilities and to do what
I want with no time constraints. I watched anime until 4 am and there were no worries of being
late for a 7 am world history class. The second month was starting to become quieter. It was like
a scene on a horror movie just before a jump scare. I finished watching all the shows that seemed
interesting and I have reread all my favorite books. The third month began a war. A war that I was
not anticipating, A war that would knock me off if I did not hold on.<br />
<br />
When my defenses were weak and my guards were down, grenades of overthinking were thrown
onto my bed. Every night there was a surprise attack, so I made strategies to schedule my harsh
thoughts in the morning. I thought this way, they would no longer bother me at night, but instead
they improvised. Insecurity mines were spread across my bedroom floor and I carefully tipped toe
to get to my bed while avoiding the mines, but they exploded still. I managed to get to my bed that
night and bandaged the cuts from the blasted shrapnel. These are going to make ugly scars. Then
I could hear a beeping sound like that of a ticking bomb. I closed my eyes to track the sound so I
could diffuse the bomb, but they seem to be all around me, on the walls, on the ceiling, on my pillow, and even under my skin. There was no way out I was surrounded and outnumbered. But I
was not going to give up without putting up a fight. I picked up the only weapon I had, a revolver
with each bullet fired from a happy thought I could muster. I shot once, my first kiss, twice, the
day I went out to eat a gallon of vanilla ice cream alone, thrice, when it was my parent’s 13th
wedding anniversary, and that was everything I got. The bombs ticked even faster, and the sounds
got even louder, I covered my ears and wished there was anything I could do.<br />
<br />
3, 2, 1, HELP ME! Someone please help me! I screamed for rescue, but no one seemed to be
fighting with me.<br />
<br />
One last draw to win this war, I took 15 sleeping pills form under my blanket. I swung them
straight to my stomach and the sound of the grenades, the mines, and the ticking bomb slowly
began to hush. I know I was winning because the enemy was retreating, this pandemic could never
bring me down. Scenes of my last bus ride replayed in front of me, the ocean by the road which
always made me blush as I pass by as a child, and the majestic mountains that stood strong even
after typhoons. I heard the beat drop as if we are to jump, I remember them all, and then it all
went black.<br />
<br />
But the next day I woke up, why did I wake up? All I saw were wrecks, my bed was turned into
ashes, the books were burnt, and there was still no one. I waited, I scanned the area and searched
for things that I can use. I found a page from <i>Eleanor and Park</i> and folded it to my pocket, I picked
up a part of what I recognize as a family picture, and then I resumed waiting. That entire day there
were no signs of enemy coming to ambush neither were there guns pointed at me. There were
none on the next day and even on the week after that. It was uncomfortably silent.
I burnt wood debris to signal people who might be passing by that I am alive, that I have survived
the war.<br />
<br />
But no one came.<br />
<br />
Enough waiting for others to come for me, I know I should begin again even if I have to walk
alone. I don’t have any idea where this road leads to. Ironically, for the first time ever my name
did not make me wise.<br />
<br />
Until I met you, I extend my arm, “Hi, I am Athena and I am a remnant of war.”<br />
<br />

<br />
There’s this girl that seemed odd to me, I met her around 3 years ago when she was walking all by
herself. Her clothes were dirty, and her face was scarred. She was holding something that looked
like a burnt photo and was crying and shaking as if she’d been through something really tragic. She
was just walking straight, and I stopped right on time before the car would hit her. I got off, and
that was the only time she looked up. Her eyes met mine and I felt something untangle inside me.
I offered her a ride and we talked about all the awful things in life. She showed me how ruins can
still be beautiful. She talked for hours until she’d fall asleep. When she wakes up, she demands we
stop by a diner because she was insanely hungry, she could eat an entire cow. She became my
friend, my best friend actually. We did things together since then, we hoped for the same things,
and shared the same dreams. We attended the same university to create the change we want for
the world. Everything was exactly where they had to be. I was happy and so was she.<br />
<br />
Until she fell in love with someone and did not even bother to ask if I’m alright. Since then, she
never ate lunch with me, neither did she come when I told her I was sick, and I needed her company. They were together for about four months and for four months we never talked. One
day, the entire school knew that he dumped her for the student council president. She became too
invested on that relationship, so when it ended, she felt that she lost everything again.<br />
<br />
It hurts seeing her like that. If only she could see what I see when I look at her.<br />
<br />
I still check up on her, secretly following her around to make sure she was fine. Until I found out
that they got back together. She flexed their ‘happy’ relationship on all her social media accounts,
she said the timing was right this time. But again, after three weeks, he dumped her for the
principal’s daughter.<br />
<br />
She came straight to me, sobbing her soul out and gasping for air. She said she survived a war, so
she will survive this one, but she needs me. I know I must not make myself available for someone
who can’t even see my worth. She tried to mend things between us, but I felt revenge. I wanted to
hurt her so bad. I hugged her tight, tied her hair in a bun like I always did, and bought her a cone
of vanilla ice cream. I told her things are going to be better, and that I’ll always be here for her.
One morning, I heard the news about a disease outbreak from China. People were advised to stay
inside their houses to decrease the rate of transmission. She asked if she could stay with me and
of course I said yes.<br />
<br />
One night she came to my room, said she needed love because she barely has enough. I set aside
my laptop and patted the space beside me. She sat and leaned close. She held my nape and slid
down her hands down my back. I inhaled and I gave her the love she thought she deserved.<br />
<br />
The numbers of confirmed cases continued to rise, and the government announced the lockdowns
will be extended for three more months. I was ecstatic because that meant I’ll get to keep her a lot
longer and it could be the perfect time to execute our grand finale.<br />
<br />
After we had our dinner, I offered her a drink and told her we should celebrate this blossoming
relationship. She stood up and gave me a kiss, and for a moment there I hesitated. I remember
how her laughter was so pure I couldn’t get enough. Her hair smells just as sweet as the first time
she got in my car. But then it all came back to me, how this odd girl had become my best friend
and how she abandoned me when she thought she had everything she wanted.<br />
<br />
The lace of her dress fell to her shoulders, her skirt touched her thighs. I just stared at her, and she
run her palms on her breast letting out a small moan. I leaned closer, and I stabbed her. Her blood
was as red as the wine she was drinking. The glass fell and broke the same time as her body. She
reached for my hand and I held her. She caressed my cheek and then she was gone.<br />
<br />
I frantically looked everywhere for her, I ran back to the kitchen, to the patio, but she was not
there. I went into our bedroom, I stood in front of her dresser, and on her vanity mirror I saw
myself. I am soaked with blood as red as wine and a knife stuck at the side of my waist.<br />
<br />
I am Athena and I am a remnant of war.<br />
