<header>THE WHITE BUILDING</header><br />
<i>by Sean Anthony Penn Lacorte</i><br />
<br />
It was twelve o’clock in the afternoon. I just got back from the hospital from a check-up.
I lay on the mattress, staring at the ceiling and holding my abdomen, ready for the next pain
brought about this illness. The phone chimed an arpeggio, I held it to my ear. I sighed, hearing the
voice of my worried girlfriend from half across the country. I told her I was leaving, that is to say,
I’d go off-the-grid. Even getting the phone was a hassle for me, the pain in my stomach crushed
me. I ended the call by throwing the phone away. I looked at the ceiling again, thinking about
taking a delicious meal. My stomach grumbled. But then, I would go back to the time where I’d
vomit for everything I ate, even water. This time, my antagonist was my stomach, it stole the life
away from me. I thought about going to the white building again, taking delicious meals, sleeping
in a soft bed, feel the presence of an air cooler. All these things were absent in our home. I suppose
living in a hospital would equate to living a good life, so I thought.<br />
<br />
My mom finished packing, and so I had to stand again. Just standing alone brought me
pain, but walking made it worse. My body became heavier , even though I became thinner. Outside
we wore face masks and shields, as everyone was told to do so. It was a societal sin to not wear
one. Streets roared with jeepneys and taxis. We got inside a taxi and opened the side windows. She
tells the driver “It’s for your own safety.” The taxi drove through the streets of downtown Davao,
seeing the sight of ragged homeless people, masked middle aged males, and blue collared
policemen as we went by. The once quiet ghost town became a buzzling city again, after months
of lockdown.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the hospital, we saw a number of people by the waiting shed, looking at the
white building we already gained access to. We went in, still holding my belly, I was walking like a
crippled person, only that my stomach was crippled. Time ticked as we were waiting for the results
of my tests. It was three hours of painful suffering, I used the coat of my jacket as my pillow and
lay my head on the backpack beside me The white building’s hallways were dark, even with the
whitest lights. Patients were scarce, I thought it would be packed, as a pandemic went on. Everyone
wore masks and face shields. You could tell the nurses and hospital workers by their green apparel.<br />
<br />
We waited outside the Emergency Room, I listened to nurses by the door talking about
swabbing and so on. I look to the other side of the hallway, it was mere silence, not a human in
sight. The door by the end of the hallway tells me it is nighttime; the crickets were singing too. My
mother, standing in front of the doctor, argued with a worried tone, as the procedures kept us
confused. The nurses and the doctor kept her calm, telling her “Everything’s alright, we got it
covered.” I was then called to the Emergency Room, where I was told to sit and place my arm on
the hospital cot. From that point on, it was a storm of needles injected onto my arm. Luckily, it
didn’t feel painful enough. I even desired the pain because my stomach was more painful than this.
The last needle injected into my veins became my best friend, the dextrose. I stared at it, greeted
it, and looked down, laying my head on the hospital bed. The sight of the dextrose brought me
relief, as I didn’t have to eat anymore. It’s not that I don’t want to eat, but the taste of stomach
acid was too horrible to be worth sacrificing for.<br />
<br />
I was placed on a wheelchair leading to the Isolation room. It was the coziest room I’ve
ever been this past six months. Just as I said, soft bed, the presence of an air cooler, and delicious
food, which I was prohibited to take. I lay down in bed, enjoying the coziness of the room. By
midnight, it became cold, I had to cover my whole body with a blanket. My mom, just a bed away
called a number of people, delegating tasks for every one of them. I slept in that bed for hours on
end. The more time that passed by, the more I lowered the air cooler’s intensity, the more I covered
myself with blankets. The doctor opened the door and walk towards me. He held my abdomen
with two fingers, pressing it to different parts on my belly. It was then we were told that I needed
a surgery, which is in fact, the scariest thing to me. As it felt new, I thought I was saying goodbye
to my big ol’ stomach. But then, not taking the surgery would mean taking away your life. I thought
it deeply, as the nurse pumped the sphygmomanometer on my left arm. The nurse said the surgery
was a painless process, but I needed a more concrete assurance of that.<br />
<br />
A day has passed, and the windows tell me it was nighttime again. I was told by my mom
that I had to take a swab test for Covid-19 if we were to take the surgery. People all around me
told that getting a swab was the most painful experience ever. And so I thought, that if taking the
swab would be that painful, maybe the surgery wont feel painful at all. I spent the night staring at
the ceiling, thinking about how painful it would be, despite being injected with needles countless
times already. My mom was eating, it was banana with fried chicken and rice, exactly what I was
craving for. My stomach grumbled, and slowly my desire of wanting to go home increased. The
desire of being better again, eating the food you once loved.<br />
<br />
The day of the swabbing arrived; I was brought inside an ambulance by a group of nurses.
And so I lay down in this bumpy ride towards the testing center. Each bump was a pain on my
belly, but I had to see the city again. Each time the streetlamps and roofs of buildings pass by, a
little sense of tranquility was brought upon me. The ambulanced roared its wee-woo sound across
the street. My mom kept taking pictures, and celebrated being inside an ambulance and all. The
ambulance stopped and the door opened, we look at the window to see if anyone was coming.
The nurse called, and someone with a full PPE suit went in the car and grabbed three cotton sticks.
I stared up, ready for the pain I was about to experience as she puts in the first stick inside my
nose. It went deep and then it was quickly ejected, I wanted to sneeze. The swabber just finished
her duty, and I still did not feel a tiny bit of pain from that swab, just discomfort. I felt a sense of
disappointment, knowing that the swab was not painful at all. It made me a little sad, it’s the
strangest thing ever.<br />
<br />
My life became a pursuit of pain, the awaiting of the most painful thing there was to exist.
Being in this hospital meant awaiting the next painful thing, and so it arrived. The nurse called me
to the operation room, leaving my mother behind in the isolation room. I was brought in a hospital
bed, dragged along the dark hallways of the white building. Later, I arrived at the jollier part of the
building, which had sunlight. The operation room had a window looking down the city, which all
the rooms lacked. I shivered over the coldness of the air cooler; I couldn’t move my arms as it was
locked in some kind of machine for pulses. The nurses gathered together by the door to the
hallway, talking about their friends getting pregnant and all. It was the funniest conversation ever,
and God I thought, this is how adulthood will be like. The surgeons arrived with their suits and
masks on, the window was shut, and darkness engulfed the room. The only light there was, was
the large lamp above me. I thought about how painful it would be, I hunted pain everywhere. I
thought about Nietzsche and Buddha, how life is full of pain and suffering and how humans always
seek for pleasure in a world full of suffering. This time, I seek for suffering. I seek for the most
painful thing to ever had existed. I was then injected with a needle on my spine, it made me numb.
It felt like my soul left the lower part of my body, and so I stare up the lights above me and saw a
reflection of blood on my abdomen. Before I knew it, it already happened, the seek of suffering
halted. It was pointless at this point. I closed my eyes and drifted on the cosmos.<br />
<br />
I woke up inside a hospital bed again, but in a different room. It was an all-white, narrow
room that had two beds, and two long seats in front of each bed. I stare at the corner of the room
and saw a tall, large, middle-aged woman along with her a tall, horizontally large, white teenage
son, who had an undercut hair. The fat kid, let’s name him Eric, lays down on the hospital bed,
alongside his dextrose. From that point on, the nurse had to take the blood pressure and
temperature of two patients. The nurse pumped the sphygmomanometer on my arm again, while
talking to my mom. They talked about what would have happened if I did not take the surgery on
time, or when the appendix inside my stomach blew up. She told us how short staffed the hospital
was, and how there was no more Intensive Care Units (ICU) in the white building. And that I was
to be brought to another hospital, with more Covid-19 patients, which was a terrible move. People
say that the virus works well on patients that have complications earlier on, which works well with
me, having my immune systems exhausted and all.<br />
<br />
Being inside this room was a pain, not because of my new wound, but because it was the
most depressing room I’ve ever been in my whole life. I opened the window, hoping for a scenic
view, I saw a rear part of a building, all black. The only light seen was high upon that building that
engulfed my view, I had to smash the window to see the sunlight. I couldn’t even tell if it was
daytime or nighttime. Everything smelled terrible, especially the food. The nurse brought in a plate
of fried chicken with rice and a banana, I looked away as it smelled terrible. It was like the scent
of a rotten pile of vegetables, combined with the medicine-like scent of the air cooler. A
combination of bitter and rotten scents. By nighttime, I could hear the voice of the whiniest kid
I’ve ever met in my life. Eric knocked the end table to wake his mother up and bring him to the
toilet, my sleep was interrupted. Jeez, I know that he’s younger than me, but he’s larger and old
enough to stand up on his own even when he is sick. Eric walked with his two feet, bringing the
dextrose to the toilet with his mother holding his back. They went back to bed talking about having
the possibility of delivering food from Penongs, fried chicken with rice and gravy, exactly what I
was craving for. But I was disallowed to take such food. Eric still spoke in a seven-year-old tone
even though he was already fifteen, he was the biggest whiner ever. The two were also talking
about how terrible the previous room was, as it didn’t have an air cooler. How I envied their
situation sometimes, I was shivering to death. And so as the two went to sleep, my mom and I
covered ourselves with multiple blankets. I shivered the whole night, combined with the pain on
my belly. I am a rotten fish refusing to decay because of this freezing temperature. This time, I
couldn’t lower the intensity of the air cooler, the kid loved these freezing climates a lot. He’s
probably a bear, I hope. My desire of wanting to go home increased. My hatred against this white
building grew, there was nothing good to see here except the depressed and hopeless faces of
patients and the haggard eyes of nurses. Smiles couldn’t be seen under the masks they wear. The
white building, was the worst place to be in. It had terrible food, freezing air coolers, and terrible
roommates. I missed sleeping in my own bed, seeing the light from the window, and the trees on
our back lawn. I turned to Buddha and Nietzsche again, reminding myself that life is full of pain
and suffering. But this time I seek for pleasure, for wellness, being able to go to online classes
again in good shape.<br />
<br />
I woke up seeing my mom and Eric’s mom talk about hospital bills. They compared each other’s
bills and knew that both had to pay over a hundred thousand pesos for paying the bills. Eric’s
mom also blabbered about how our surgeon is untrustworthy, making mistakes about the
diagnosis. And even how big the surgeon’s salary is, comparing it to the big car he has outside.
The door suddenly opens and the surgeon goes in. He touches Eric’s belly and gives the diagnosis
and the request for a surgery. Eric then blabbers his worries, assured by his mother that Jesus will
be there, and that he cares. The surgeon then goes to me and tells my mom that I can go home
and that I can only eat as little meals as possible. And so, my mom started packing, I lay down
waiting for the nurse to arrive to remove the dextrose. I look at my hand bleeding, as the dextrose
pumps liquids along the stain of blood, stuck in the tube. The nurse arrives and removes the
dextrose from me, she holds it with a piece of cotton and pulls it slowly from the veins of my
hand. I say goodbye to my dear best friend dextrose. I was put in a wheelchair and brought to an
elevator leading to the first floor. I looked around the hallways of the white building as I passed
by on a wheelchair. It is still as dark and tranquil as before, nurses rush from room to room,
patients sit along the side. All of them covered with masks, emotionless, along with green suits and
bouffant caps. The lights along the hallway were just pale white lights, dimming the entire passage.
By the end of the corridor, the door opened with a ray of sunlight. My wheelchair was pushed, and
it was the first time in many weeks I saw the sun and the trees, greeting me in a hot afternoon.<br />
<br />
I arrived at home, in my very own room and lay on my humble mattress laying on the
floor. My mattress felt softer and more loving than the hospital bed I was once in. And then, I said
to myself; never again will I go back to that white building full of sorrow and despair.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the room, I hear my mom and dad talking about how big the bills
were. It even added up knowing that I had to pay the tuition for my finals, knowing that I am in
the most expensive university in the city. A hundred thousand pesos is the biggest luxury one can
have, even for a middle-class citizen. You can buy a car with that kind of money already. I sat on
the mattress and check on my phone and saw a flood of text messages from my worried girlfriend.
And so I thought, if we start to live together as working adults. Our wages will have to be as high
as a hundred thousand dollars to be able to survive in a healthcare crisis such as this. If we were
not able to accumulate that much money, we will be brought to a stagnant position, starving,
drowning in debts and begging to people of higher power. I then turn to Nietzsche and Buddha
again. Is it true that living is more expensive than dying? After all, it cost us all that much pain and
cash to save me from an exploding appendix. Is living even worth it when it costs more than what
your labor can compensate? I asked myself.<br />
