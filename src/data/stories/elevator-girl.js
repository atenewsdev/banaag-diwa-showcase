<br />
I. Slander
<br />
The news spread like blood on clean waters. In all its history of social excellence, the
University had never been host to something so vile and scandalous. So wide was its reach that it
tainted the softest murmurs with curiosity and malice. Even the trees which decorated the school’s
ceremonial grounds stooped to eavesdrop, its leaves rustling with light banter. The wind thus
smuggled secret conversations from crowded cafeteria tables and breached into the crevices of
ceramic bathroom tiles poised like open ears. Though details were silently added or omitted with
every new story, the thought remained: nothing of such a vile nature had been done before.<br />
<br />
II. Law
<br />
Of course, there can never be any bureaucracy without the dire need for protocol. Or is it
the other way around? Nevertheless, the University was not short of this. In fact, they had a thick
Manual for how to deal with all types of disaster, including scandals of a Satanic kind. That was
why, shortly after the dreadful incident had taken place (more accurately, after a student or two
had fainted from seeing the gruesome evidence it had left), the school’s board of directors gathered
like bees in their air-conditioned hive to discuss what could be done. They strode towards their
seats with sweaty sleeves yet filled with the thrill of a newfound conviction they had never gained
in all their previous administrative work: theirs was now a heroic duty to quarantine the rumors
before its poison could inflict its disease elsewhere.<br />
<br />
III. Inferno
<br />
Our image, one of them exclaimed, is of grave importance. We cannot afford to let dirty
talk reach the streets and make headlines! The ones who were sitting nodded their heads in unison
and some who were known to be religious people proceeded to rebuke the incident since it was apparent that it had not come from a good spirit, but that it was a scheme of the devil, who sought
relentlessly to disrupt the school’s noble vision and mission. How could we have allowed such
darkness to penetrate the honorable walls of this university? No one has ever raised a fist! This is
a grave insult to us who have worked hard to preserve the peace, only to have it crushed like castles
built of sand. Now, now, it was not our fault. Yes, there was nothing we could have done.<br />
<br />
So they mourned and wept, mourned and wept, their sorrowful chorus finally silencing the
loud vibrations of the air conditioner which often rose in awkward competition against their
sincere wailing. After that brief ritual of mourning, they pounded their chests and buried their
ostrich heads back in their manuals, grumbling with words of retribution as they ended the meeting
in prayer, <i>lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen.</i><br />
<br />
IV. A Greater Good
<br />
It is said that the past holds clues to the present and that history has the tendency to divulge
its own secrets. One could easily presume that the entire fiasco was linked to a report issued seven
weeks ago announcing the removal of seventeen maintenance personnel: from janitors, repair
workers, private bus drivers, to elevator girls.<br />
<br />
A short, petite woman in awkward limbo between juvenescence and age, the woman’s
name being Beverly, was sitting at her assigned post inside Elevator no. 3 when the news broke
out like water by a wind perpetually impregnated by school gossip. Nevertheless, she had been
hinted about the evictions before any document was released. A few of these workers she knew
personally. They were acquaintances and past lovers, like Berto the Janitor to whom she had once
been engaged.<br />
<br />
If one counts the years since her birth, Beverly was quite young. Yet years of hard labor
and toil had quickened the passing of days and had stolen from her what youth granted to its more
privileged subjects. After finally losing her mother to a terrible disease, her aunt, branding herself
as an experienced woman but cursed to learn from her own misgivings, had managed to convince
her orphaned niece that it would be smart to work in a place that held values in prime esteem and
more importantly, a place with a saintly capacity for sympathy. Listen, you are in a profitable
situation, she blurted out one evening without any tone of shame. There could simply be no other
explanation, then, for the miracle apart from her aunt’s persistency in prayer which must have
coaxed Heaven into casting the young Beverly into a job inside a university, one that held a fine
reputation for charity and good deeds.<br />
<br />
In spite the appearance of its alienating nature, Beverly confessed that she liked her job.
She felt quite content that she was getting paid to enclose herself in an iron box from sunrise to
sunset than to be assigned to clean an entire building. Minimum wage for minimum labor, it
seemed at first. Besides, she marveled that there was a kind of God-ness in the ability to control
which direction the elevator went. It went up and down at her command. The passengers were all
at her mercy. She needed only to press the necessary buttons and the elevator opened its mouth
to drink in the long line of people waiting outside. It was on such days that the news of the
seventeen emerged from layers of indistinct voices:<br />
<br />
“Fifth floor po, ate.”<br />
<br />
“Jusme, we’re late!”<br />
<br />
“You heard the news? They took out seventeen of them yesterday. Unauthorized absences,
they said. Talk about tenure.”<br />
<br />
“Just like that?”<br />
<br />
“Just like that! They called them in for a meeting though. All seventeen of them. And
simply told them they were off the contract, fired from the agency. Can you believe it? I heard it
from Jason this morning. He’s our new janitor.”<br />
<br />
“Fair enough, you can’t cut down the costs if you can’t cut down some people.”<br />
<br />
When the elevator opened once more, the hushed conversations were followed by a flurry
of customary <i>thank you</i>s.<br />
<br />
V. Innocence
<br />
Of course, Beverly did not take the news to heart. She knew the Agency would provide
these workers with alternative jobs and surely, a University such as the one she worked in would
labor to pursue the justice needed to compensate for the loss of what little livelihood they had.<br />
<br />
There was still much that could happen.<br />
<br />
For a while, Beverly stared intently at the crooked mix of colors that vaguely reflected her
image on the steel walls. It was in absent moments like these when Beverly took to an orange
pocketbook dictionary for refuge. The small dictionary was a Christmas gift given to her by one
of the professors in the University during her first year as an elevator girl. Whether it was a gesture
of gratitude or something else, Beverly did not find the need to ask.<br />
<br />
When the passengers were few and there was not much to do during the day, she would
busy herself chanting newfound words in the dictionary like a spell that can maybe create portals
to new worlds, opening and closing, opening and closing to greet her with visions of countless
futures, parallel universes where she has acquired the position to say Fifth floor po, Ate, the tongue
free to play with and boast of the strangeness of these sounds.<br />
<br />
There was still so much that could happen.<br />
<br />
Though she was new to the University and still had a lot to learn about the general flow of
things, she could already sense the goodwill and intentionality of its inhabitants, how mild-
mannered they were even in their stride. From the right place, the students almost appeared like
an undisturbed army of termites stuck to their duties and responsibilities. There was hardly ever a
day when the halls were mellowed by their lassitude.<br />
<br />
It was only when Berto came to her at lunchbreak and dragged her by the wrist into one
of the storage rooms when she broke away from her mindwandering and understood the weight
of the word:<br />
<br />
VI. Retrenchment
<br />
“They took you out too? Just like that?”<br />
<br />
“Just like that! Didn’t even bother to hand me the proper forms. Plucked me from the
ground like a weed.”<br />
<br />
“What are you going to do?”<br />
<br />
“What am I going to do? This is not just about me, Bev. You’re part of this struggle too.
Sure you haven’t been fired yet. But wait till you see just how much of a hypocrite these Catholics
are. The law is always on their side and one day they’ll accuse you of something you’re not even
guilty of. And then you’ll start thinking about ‘we’. You really want to wait that long?”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry. I—”<br />
<br />
“You’re so stuck in that box of yours you haven’t been paying attention to what’s around
you. Did you hear? The Union is planning to start a riot. Right outside the gates. They’ll start soon.
Perhaps in the morning so everyone who comes will see. They’ll never listen to us, Bev. We need
to shove it right in front of their faces. Make them afraid. That’s how it works for people like us.”<br />
<br />
“But Berto—”<br />
<br />
Already, Berto had his back towards Beverly. He opened the door to see if anyone was
watching and sprinted away without saying any goodbye.<br />
<br />
VII. Conspiracy
<br />
When Beverly left the storage room and returned to the cold elevator, she noticed a
spectacled man standing outside. His gaze pierced through the narrowing space between the iron
doors until it reached hers.<br />
<br />
VIII. Dismissal
<br />
The next day came swiftly. The bell sounded one final ring to signal the end of classes.
There were not a lot of passengers that day. News of a secret sickness spreading throughout the
world drove most of the students to return home earlier than usual. There was also no riot in sight
since the morning. Beverly made a quick sigh of relief. Perhaps the Union had changed its mind,
turned towards diplomatic means. See, things have a way of reconciling themselves, Beverly
assured herself. It all works together for good.<br />
<br />
Feeling an unwelcome pulsing in her chest, she left the elevator to take a short bathroom
break and wash her face. As she came back, something terrible greeted her. Sitting on her
monobloc chair inside Elevator no. 3 was a small envelope. Beverly quickly grabbed it, tore the
sides, and took out the strange note. Excluding the details written for sake of formality, the letter
properly read:<br />
<br />
<center>
Dear Ms. Beverly,<br />
YOUR CONTRACT HAS BEEN TERMINATED.<br />
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.<br />
</center>
<br />
<br />
IX. Euphemism
<br />
Just like that.<br />
<br />
Beverly snickered.<br />
<br />
The monobloc chair had always seemed like a silent yet constant affirmation to her dignity
as a human being. Looking at it now, how curious it was that the indiscretion of a small, white
envelope could render something so personally sacred void and perishable. The phrase Thank You
now screamed the trauma of rejection, abandonment.<br />
<br />
X. Futility
<br />
Beverly sank slowly onto the cool steel floor and curled her body. Then she forced herself
again into laughter. Her bickering saturated all the hollow spaces so there was no need to fill it
with tears. She bit the edges of her fingers until it bled and on the door she painted the words:<br />
<br />
<center>
YOU’RE WELCOME.<br />
</center>
<br />
She laughed again. For three years, she had been trained to say these words in her best
English. Treat the passengers with extreme politeness, they said. Be discreet, they said.<br />
<br />
Beverly savored the sight and smiled to herself. She had staged a grand exit, her own riot,
a reprisal of sorts. Berto and the Union would be proud.<br />
<br />
Then Beverly, covering her bloodied fingers inside the hem of her shirt, went out of
Elevator no. 3 with her eyes fixed mindlessly toward the looming school gate.<br />
<br />
She left the University without looking back and walked the familiar path home. Stuck in
an unforgiving trance, she obscured herself from the world outside as though it was not burning
around her.<br />
