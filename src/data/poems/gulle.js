<br />
In this year of chaos,<br />
This devastating time,<br />
This God-forsaken life,<br />
This ruthless beginning;<br />
<br />
Two thousand and twenty:<br />
When death is more than life;<br />
When pain is hard to heal,<br />
When the days are the worst.<br />
<br />
Everyone is struggling,<br />
From the loss of their jobs,<br />
From this wicked sickness,<br />
From the vile happenings.<br />
<br />
Everyone is struggling,<br />
In their disastrous homes,<br />
In their unsettling minds,<br />
In their restless bodies.<br />
<br />
Everyone is struggling.<br />
Everyone is hopeless.<br />
Everyone is dying.<br />
I, however, am not.<br />
<br />
I, however, am safe.<br />
I, however, am fine.<br />
I, however, am sane.<br />
Hence, I am not struggling.<br />
<br />
I have fewer problems,<br />
None of which are serious,<br />
Crucial, or critical.<br />
None of them do matters.<br />
<br />
All this time in my life,<br />
I am so fortunate.<br />
All this time in my life,<br />
I am alive and well.<br />
<br />
Yet, somehow, I feel wrong,<br />
Of how lucky I am,<br />
Of how blessed my life is,<br />
Of how tranquil my home is.<br />
<br />
My life right now is great.<br />
And, oh, how unfair ‘twas,<br />
For the people to live,<br />
In a life that is hell.<br />
<br />
Oh, how truly indeed,<br />
That in this awful year,<br />
It is not the right time,<br />
To be so fortunate....<br />

Everything could get worse.<br />
From the almost third World War,<br />
To the respected people’s death,<br />
To the massive city explosion.<br />
<br />
Everything could get worse.<br />
From police brutality,<br />
To poorer government actions,<br />
To hellish natural disasters.<br />
<br />
Everything could get worse.<br />
From daily abuse in homes,<br />
To mental breakdown, every day,<br />
To any illness getting bad.<br />
<br />
Everything could get worse.<br />
From panic and delusions,<br />
To loss and death of everyone,<br />
To discrimination and bias.<br />
<br />
Everything could get worse.<br />
No matter what time it is.<br />
And the worst of them all,<br />
Is still about to come.<br />
