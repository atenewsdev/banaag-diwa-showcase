<b>Death of a Daydreamer</b><br />
<i>by Ronald Jay Ortiz</i><br />
<br />
Focus drifts and mind keeps daydreaming<br />
The heart never fails to be so ambitious<br />
That maybe, someday, you’ll rescue me<br />
I’ll feel your warm hands over my eyes<br />
And your gentle voice upon my ears<br />
As you whisper “Guess who?”<br />
Wouldn’t that be something.<br />
I might feel your touch upon my hand<br />
Maybe a pressure around my chest<br />
I have it in heart and mind that I<br />
Would dive right in, if it seemed like<br />
You would dream of me, like I do you<br />
But, by bitter day and somber night<br />
All it is, is but a dream of a heart in flight<br />
The fall from which, kills me everyday<br />
What a life it is, to die inside, every time<br />
I awake from my daydreams<br />
<br />
<b>Poison Marked Love</b><br />
<i>by Ronald Jay Ortiz</i><br />
<br />
You hold out your words for the thousandth time<br />
I dare resist, but my every being yearns desperately<br />
To feel upon my lips, the warm kiss of your cup<br />
Quench this thirst of mine with your touch sublime<br />
For I care not of your poison marked love, happily<br />
I will drink from it, and even drown on the last drop<br />
<br />
<b>Relapse</b><br />
<i>by Ronald Jay Ortiz</i><br />
<br />
I drank and drank from my bottle of depression<br />
Creeping insidiously, it became my addiction<br />
Now there is no way out of this obsession<br />
I’m always drunk and dying from this affliction<br />
<br />
Though, I have your words to keep me sober<br />
But then I relapse, it resets and starts all over<br />
My addiction becomes you, and you become colder<br />
So, I drink from my bottle of depression to get warmer<br />
<br />
<b>Passing</b><br />
<i>by Ronald Jay Ortiz</i><br />
<br />
The last glimpse I took<br />
&nbsp;Of your eyes<br />
Infinite meanings in a look<br />
&nbsp;Tears into cries<br />
For when that little hope<br />
&nbsp;Became a loss<br />
I was at the end of my rope<br />
&nbsp;Begging the cross<br />
Bring her back to me please<br />
&nbsp;I pleaded it to be<br />
But then began the cold breeze<br />
&nbsp;Winter-clad agony<br />`;
