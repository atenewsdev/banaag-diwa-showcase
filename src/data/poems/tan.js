01: Travel Time<br />
<br />
Abba,<br />
are we there yet<br />
<br />
to the green fields where our heads can lay,<br />
our eyes sucking in the sight of the sky above<br />
in all its blue starry canvas hue<br />
<br />
to the still waters that run along<br />
with the steady pace of nature<br />
that calls us to peace and quiet and rest<br />
<br />
how much further<br />
<br />
I woke up today to screams of rescue in my ears,<br />
wails bouncing around the dead of night<br />
as emptiness engulfed darkness in the valley<br />
<br />
I can still see the red plumes above the mountains<br />
after they devoured the bush and the west coast;<br />
roos and wines left to ashes of their trees<br />
<br />
the heavens are still black with fury,<br />
with raining floods, with slapping winds;<br />
babes stay afloat by submerged hands<br />
<br />
when does the road end<br />
<br />
I cannot breathe from the filters<br />
meant to keep me alive from the unseen<br />
hand which claws down the throat<br />
to pierce the lung<br />
<br />
and the vipers tell me: Resilience!<br />
as they stay in their crystal dens<br />
with their hands in everyone’s pockets<br />
while fists project out in bold salute<br />
<br />
where are we<br />
<br />
do you know the path you drive us through<br />
to a feast with overflowing cups<br />
in the expanse of your courtly home—<br />
<br />
while enemies surround me in my head<br />
no way out but to lay down and fade<br />
for what is there in the days to come<br />
<br />
I shudder to imagine how many souls<br />
I yet have to see passing by like bullets<br />
as traps spring from out of the blue sky<br />
<br />
But who am I when there are miles<br />
for us to go before we sleep, I am<br />
in the backseat, far away from the wheel<br />
<br />
There is no stopping the speed of travel;<br />
when had there ever been control<br />
even as we feigned lordship over life<br />
<br />
Yet all this is a puff huffed for a moment<br />
then gone once icy hands have taken hold,<br />
still the last word is yours:<br />
your goodness follows for the rest of days.<br />
<br />
02: Zoom Phantoms<br />

It always begins at dusk<br />
when the clock beats five<br />
finger-clicks in a rush,<br />
another night of haunting.<br />
<br />
The faces before me are ghosts;<br />
they appear and leave like flashes<br />
and gift me with veiled figures<br />
or their names in bold.<br />
<br />
They almost never speak,<br />
only when called upon by the head<br />
apparition, the only one I can<br />
keep sight of every night.<br />
<br />
I hear its voice echo around<br />
the four corners of my ears,<br />
though it is wordless, a sound<br />
groaning about as my eyes blur.<br />
<br />
My name was called once though,<br />
a few times, the head brought me<br />
forth through the tiny hole of capture<br />
as I am my own specter.<br />
<br />
Four corners of the screen<br />
trap us together yet<br />
our eyes never meet<br />
as spirits are wont to do.<br />
<br />
In our captivity, each night<br />
leads to our fading away<br />
as some had already faded<br />
to beds where there is rest.<br />
<br />
03: Nocturne<br />
<br />
My nights are long days when I<br />
sit before laws meant to govern<br />
a land on its knees, a multitude<br />
of decisions by the supreme for<br />
the guidance of the bar-bench, I<br />
am meant to study and spew forth<br />
words of import for the application<br />
of those which should govern for<br />
the orderly conduct of human life<br />
in spite of the disease in the air<br />
and many have gone, yet I am<br />
still here sitting in the twilight spent<br />
nights in my past for the purpose<br />
of someday serving the interests<br />
of the unseeing lady with sword<br />
and scales for the good of this land<br />
of storms and floods and bald forests,<br />
for who else is there but the next batch<br />
of servants since the drivers are too<br />
drunk to see the road, the carriage<br />
wobbles and too many have fallen<br />
out into waters deep and dark,<br />
still the drunken men drive for<br />
the sake of their wine overflowing<br />
when all should have had a taste<br />
of the grapes they grew, worked for,<br />
died for, but this is not a land<br />
of milk and honey after thieves<br />
have stolen almost all from the trees,<br />
and how can I continue to study<br />
when their sins and mine have<br />
tipped the scales too far for it<br />
to even out in any lifetime but<br />
the cross brings peace and a blade<br />
to pit humans against their own<br />
for whoever clings to life will lose<br />
and whoever loses their life for<br />
the good news of justice by<br />
the Infinite’s judgment will find<br />
abundant life beyond the waters<br />
that cover this land, and judgment<br />
will come for these hands and all<br />
else until the drunken men choke<br />
on their wine and spew out<br />
their entrails out before eternal<br />
fire but now they raise their glasses<br />
for they are unseeing of their end—<br />
<br />
and for this, for those who’ve passed<br />
without the good news, I<br />
study.<br />`;
