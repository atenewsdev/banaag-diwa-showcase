<header>Grace of Pandemya</header><br />
<i>by Marie Anne Bernal </i><br />
<br />
A world once free and full of love<br />
Is now in need of help from above<br />
Can there be hope and chance to live?<br />
For those who has been enveloped by grieve<br />
<br />
People are now filled with schemes<br />
News spreads with politician screams<br />
Can the world still be saved from greedy thirst?<br />
And once grasp the spirit of peace?<br />
<br />
It is not the time to meet sorrow of despair<br />
There is still a syringe of vaccine for the lives to spare<br />
A light to withstand every calamity<br />
To Hope and Let faith be strong, to experience eternity<br />
<br />
Should never give up and stand tall<br />
With Prayer as our shield for the salvation of all<br />
May heavenâ€™s loving warmth bestow<br />
To forever withhold the loving grace and sow<br />`;
