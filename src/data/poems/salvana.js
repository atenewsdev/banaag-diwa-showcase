<header>Hibernation</header><br />
<i>by Ian Salvaña</i><br />
<br />
I wear no brief, no boxer,<br />
and in the dead of night, lay motionless<br />
in my bed. It’s the middle of winter, and the dark<br />
remains a day for a week. I let it peak<br />
within the comforter, the cold seep through skin,<br />
make sense of the body playing the role of a corpse.<br />
The room, a massive blackout, an outer space<br />
with unintelligible corners. Except that<br />
the sense of touch sees through walls, cabinets,<br />
the table. And the feet can navigate the map<br />
of the carpet, friction playing as vision.<br />
There’s no blues, now and in the coming days.<br />
Only rest, and only pauses in breathing,<br />
the metonymy of heartbeat. Throat itches<br />
develop from absence of speech. Seeming years<br />
without moving lips. The mind retracts<br />
to its instincts of survival and gathers the heat<br />
trapped within the tomb of blanket,<br />
a temporary shelter, to renew my animal<br />
soul. When the first leaf sprouts from a tree<br />
outside, I will get up, the slow burn of warmth<br />
leaving me, blending with the world.<br />
This will be months from now, and by then<br />
I would have forgotten if I have slept, dreamt,<br />
lost memories about me, in the long<br />
hours predating the sun.<br />

<i>In mid-March 2020 Europe was declared</i><br />
<i>the new epicenter of the Covid-19 outbreak</i><br />
<br />
Today I saw a bee, seemingly looking for a daughter, lost<br />
in the lawn. Across the green, some patch nests marigold blossoms,<br />
I think. A handful. Signs of springtime. The bee is out of the hive,<br />
and the flowers get tanned with me under the sun. I love the sun.<br />
It pins its luminance to my eyes, and when I go blind, I seek<br />
how the sun is doing in other parts of the world. Flights are cheap now.<br />
To Kazakhstan or Kosovo or Greece. But they’re empty, I assume.<br />
No one moves these days. In privileged homes, people stay,<br />
cook homemade chicken broth, drink tea. Here in Budapest, my cup<br />
is no more than a battered, empty tea bag. I’ll write some more,<br />
all my imaginings tucked under my itchy feet, as I sit assuredly,<br />
a table warmed by the late March daylight, some last leaves falling,<br />
swinging in front of me. I need some more minty water, boiling,<br />
and let its hot not numb by tongue. A blissful life is a cliché life:<br />
shadows of the naked tree above me wrap my shoulders in silhouette.<br />
I can’t feel anything except the wind, the chorale of birds, some<br />
people breathing. Life is still soothing, at least, until now, and maybe<br />
until tomorrow. Silent. And yes, still I write of the bee buzzing,<br />
completing the rhythm of some music, the final notes of this poem.<br />

<br />
February. It’s chilly and the night devours<br />
darkness itself. Three Mongolians approach me,<br />
halting my humming to a western pop tune.<br />
The glass separating us in the bus stop<br />
shatters, a voice cracks. The smell of weed,<br />
little bit of wine, the pupils of his eyes swim<br />
near reds. He asks me if I were Chinese.<br />
His pointed finger sharper than a knife<br />
it rips open skins. My skin. And my tangled<br />
nerves a rope hanging me in the head.<br />
<i>No, I’m not.</i> Reply after the long silence. <i>Why?</i><br />
Two minutes before the bus. I imagine cocaine<br />
snowing. The gush of a wilting stream absent<br />
nearby. Slowly, slowly, I breathe and my lungs<br />
suffer from the toxic air. <i>But you look Chinese.</i><br />
<br />
How does it feel to freeze? Seconds become<br />
years, and numbing fears, I hide the curves<br />
of my face, my black hair, my brown skin.<br />
Because I’m not yellow but nobody sees it. <br />
I escape frozen, the cold is an icepick,<br />
and just with that, he kicks both my wrists,<br />
crossed together, before I became limp.<br />
Hasty, the bus arrives, I run and run and run<br />
and gulp all waters in my body. Inside it<br />
bringing tomorrow, I smile. <i>It’s just nothing.</i><br />
<br />
The next day I sit facing the window<br />
in my room. The walls a womb of forests<br />
and I hear birds. And then there it is, I freeze<br />
again. Again and again I move and yet nothing.<br />
For days I force myself to cry and water<br />
the city in tears. But the soil dried up, and<br />
for months the blanket of winter slowly folds.<br />
What does it mean to be free? Nobody knows.<br />
May and the springtime sun is up. Isolation<br />
heals a heart from surgery. One night it rained<br />
hard, and the windowpane opened, I slept<br />
undisturbed. The next day flowers bloom.<br />
<br />
<header>I can finally write a poem</header><br />
<i>for Natalia</i><br />
<i>by Ian Salvaña</i><br />
<br />
When words are contrite, how do I read this world<br />
in the languages I know, those that make me myself?<br />
Language grieves when we get limited with our lips.<br />
After all, my Kinamayo is a rice field misfit in the Amazon.<br />
<br />
And the Amazon an occupation of hardwired boondocks<br />
forced to adopt Portuguese. Either way, all is foreign to me<br />
as it is using English across Lumad islands in the Pacific.<br />
I am a child of old Spanish names, and I have since then<br />
<br />
looked for sounds to mimic, make do for meaning.<br />
I have known Cautivo means captive, a cave of history<br />
within my family, a colony of people bereft of dawot,<br />
elegies of flowers wilting, in lands they think of as home.<br />
<br />
Only there is hope for a language reborn to know<br />
new selves, learn anew life. Three months of poetry’s<br />
absence, and I’m struck, hungry, for voice. I just need<br />
anything, really, to calm typhoons during wet season<br />

and hydrate El Niño when the sun overextends its stay.<br />
I’m stuck with the same words now that I am free of debt<br />
from lost friendships. I’m still as a lagoon 40km away<br />
from this town, a portrait of rubble drowned in blue,<br />

missing from sight. Because it is only the water the shallow<br />
swimmer can touch. Because the young skin can never<br />
ease itself from movement. Because everything is missed<br />
when one goes slow. Well today, I burdened the water<br />

with my floating body. I soaked all the sunlight there is<br />
in this country. I made the world rain without clouds<br />
only to feel how it is to be alive. Because I need touch<br />
when I’m lost with words. Because I am a poet of verses

in tongues I don’t understand. <i>Madaig na pangutana na dili</i><br />
<i>matubag</i>—questions unanswered, but I am only left to ask<br />
so as to feel. Because I feel most or I don’t feel at all. Because<br />
I don’t feel at all when there are no words keeping us in touch.<br />
