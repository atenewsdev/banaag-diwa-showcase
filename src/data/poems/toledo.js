<header>Lockdown</header><br />
<i>by Miguel Angelo Francesco Toledo</i><br />
<br />
On the 16th of March,<br />
Many watched.<br />
As the borders close,<br />
With the silent virus, many stranded and lost.<br />
<br />
It should have been January.<br />
Theses fools could have been wary.<br />
Rather than to appease the sleeping Giant<br />
Suppress their foes to keep them silent.<br />
<br />
Health workers save their frail patients’ lives<br />
As they risk themselves and put the lives of their safety first.<br />
Martyrs of the new normal.<br />
Underpaid, overworked sacrificial lambs in formal.<br />
<br />
Education still continues in the virtual space,<br />
As students and teachers struggle in their pace.<br />
With requirements infinite that would take forever to accomplish,<br />
Finding the motivation they badly wish.<br />
<br />
Employees walking their way to work<br />
With dripping sweat for all that’s worth<br />
Even with fewer mass transport<br />
Anything for their family they’ll do with effort<br />
<br />
In this shift of normalcy,<br />
Yet no sense of urgency.<br />
Unless when it comes to their foes.<br />
<br />
Red-tagging those who oppose.<br />
<br />
Nine months later, feels like forever.<br />
No sign of slowing down, no concrete plans whatsoever.<br />
Misaligned priorities, sinister motives.<br />
ECQ, MECQ, GCQ, MGCQ, on repeat.<br />
<br />
Where do we go from here?<br />
It feels like we’re on our own now.<br />
As our cries and appeals fall on deaf ears,<br />
Let it not discourage us, but to be amplifiers of tomorrow.<br />
<br />
<header>Protocol</header><br />
<i>by Miguel Angelo Francesco Toledo</i><br />
<br />
Stay at home.<br />
Observe social distancing.<br />
No one allowed to roam alone.<br />
Unless anything essential is what we’re spending.<br />
<br />
The law is the law.<br />
Follow the quarantine health protocols.<br />
When the lawmakers and enforcers fall to their fatal flaws,<br />
Who do we run to and call?<br />
<br />
If we’ve read and heard the news,<br />
People losing their bread and butter.<br />
With barely money, they’ve nothing to lose.<br />
Leaving their homes with the risk of getting exposed and bound to the steel handcuffs suffered.<br />
<br />
“The law is harsh but it is the law.”<br />
Dura lex, sed lex.<br />
Rambles in the dead of the night with no withdraw.<br />
Instead of talking about plans, blaming the opposition and placing them to the left.<br />
<br />
If the rules should be followed, then are they fair?<br />
When they cause more divide and lives at stake.<br />
The rich and the privileged get away, the poor behind bars and barely no money to bail.<br />
Where’s the compassion when your sympathy is misplaced?<br />
<br />
To hell with restrictions if we adhere to them only for these clowns to break.<br />
Said they’re only for our own good, but only good to abuse.<br />
Bold of them to arrest violators, with evidence as fake.<br />
<br />
Pull off a manañita, social distancing from your own rules, that’s no excuse!<br />
<br />
Social media influenzas pointing fingers at the masses.<br />
Cursing, saying they lack discipline.<br />
Yet post on their IG Stories partying and eating out with their friends without face masks.<br />
Like there’s no tomorrow, as if there is no pandemic happenin’.<br />
<br />
Observe the health and safety protocols.<br />
They urged, yet how can we trust them?<br />
With their glaring hypocrisy and proud apathy as their downfall,<br />
Let this open our eyes to fix this broken and never-ending system.<br />
<br />
<header>Resilient</header><br />
<i>by Miguel Angelo Francesco Toledo</i><br />
<br />
We are resilient<br />
This is what we say<br />
Filled with the Bayanihan spirit<br />
To overcome trials and help each other in every way.<br />
<br />
We are resilient<br />
This is what they show<br />
With the cameras present<br />
The blur between romance and tragedy of the masses’ woe.<br />
<br />
They are resilient<br />
This is what they assure<br />
With dull minds deemed brilliant<br />
Broken and twisted promises they lure.<br />
<br />
They were resilient<br />
This is what they realized<br />
Leaders malevolently blind to their incompetence<br />
Slaves to their self-serving lives.<br />
<br />
We are resilient<br />
There is nothing wrong with it<br />
As long we don’t let them exploit us like an abuser’s gaslighting intent<br />
Hold them accountable and to their citizens’ welfare they commit.<br />
<br />
<header>Kagaya ng Dati</header><br />
<i>by Miguel Angelo Francesco Toledo</i><br />
<br />
Ilang araw, buwan, o taon ang kailangan kong hintayin<br />
Para matapos itong pandemya?<br />
Pagod na manatili sa apat na sulok ng dingding<br />
At ang gulong-gulo na utak, sana’y maging malaya.<br />
<br />
Habang nakatanaw sa mga litrato sa aking selpon,<br />
Biglang naalala mga masasayang araw na kasama ko<br />
Ang mga kaibigan ko, nahihinayang sa mga pagkakataon<br />
Na sinayang ko, maibabalik pa kaya ito?<br />
<br />
Paano na ang mga taunang family reunions?<br />
Kung bawal ang mga malalaki’t magarbong pagtitipon.<br />
Titiis na lang muna sa mga pag-uusap sa Messenger at Zoom.<br />
Dahil sa pananabik na makita’t makipagkwentuhan matapos ang mahabang panahon.<br />
<br />
Nakalulungkot na bihira na ako makaluwas at makagala.<br />
Nang walang pangamba<br />
Sa mga matatayog na mga gusali sa Ayala.<br />
Dati’y masigla at siksikan parang sardinas, ngayo’y matamlay na.<br />
<br />
Kailan kaya magwawakas itong malagim at mapangangib na sakuna?<br />
Kahit na masakit, ang mga naudlot na mga plano ay isasantabi.<br />
Hanggang sa dumating ang bakuna,<br />
Umaasa na sana’y bumalik kagaya ng dati.<br />`;
