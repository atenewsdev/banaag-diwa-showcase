<header>Daily Routine</header><br />
<i>by Frances Dane Delfin </i><br />
<br />
The flick of a switch turned out the lights<br />
Eyes have shut while sheets caress the skin<br />
A drop of tear shed in the dark<br />
Along comes a heavy heart<br />
By day, comes a plastered smile<br />
A mind set to get things done<br />
And like a routine, the night devours<br />
The vulnerable in the most trying times<br />
<br />
<header>The Domino Effect</header><br />
<i>by Frances Dane Delfin </i><br />
<br />
To the ones behind the patients’ smiles<br />
To the ones that heed a survivor’s cries<br />
To the ones who risked just to provide<br />
To the ones who listened to a friend<br />
To the ones who lend a hand<br />
To the ones who shared when they had none<br />
There are no such things as small deeds<br />
Like dominoes at play, every act of generosity<br />
Fuels the hope in humanity<br />
<br />
<header>Unrest</header><br />
<i>by Frances Dane Delfin </i><br />
<br />
Will we ever sleep so soundly?<br />
When at night<br />
Bad dreams start preying<br />
On evening souls that wander<br />
Along ‘what ifs’ and possibilities<br />
Hopes and dreams<br />
And wishful thinking<br />
That are nothing but a creation<br />
Of purely soft hearts wanting<br />
For a good night’s sleep<br />`;
