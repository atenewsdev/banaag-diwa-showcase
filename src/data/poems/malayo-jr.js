<b>A Tabula Rasa</b><br />
<i>by Jose Ronnie Malayo Jr.</i><br />
<br />
I wake up blank, but my feet move to the kitchen<br />
With the delight of baked goods, I take and munch;<br />
Every bite is like a luster of woven fine linen,<br />
As I stare in the walls wondering with a hunch,<br />
Dare asked me, "Will it traverse here, but when?"<br />
<br />
Uncertainty gallops me with leak black ocean thoughts,<br />
I sneak a look in our balcony; the school seems empty,<br />
My eyes picture the dearth of playful children ought.<br />
Drowning in despair and unusual things darken anxiety,<br />
Asking myself again, "In such a time like this, what now?"<br />
<br />
I was in my major class, preparing for tomorrow's exam.<br />
Suddenly, a pandemic I never reckoned would strike here;<br />
What a flabbergasting experience, then it becomes a bam!<br />
Everyone's panic-stricken, hasten here and there;<br />
These were clear-cut flashbacks back in the university.<br />
<br />
This pandemic pushed me earlier toward my province;<br />
Like migratory birds returning to where they're born.<br />
This pandemic is a contagion of a virus with fear hence;<br />
A web of panic, angst, gloom, but I will never be forlorn!<br />
Woe to us! Is this the end? or the beginning of sorrows?<br />
<br />
Virus, virus! Why such haste in my college days?<br />
You bequeath the new normal wherefore I cling;<br />
A world of mine has been hurled into a new phase,<br />
Virus, virus! You will not petrify me with your sting!<br />
And with a clean slate, I begin my story with an upraise.<br />
<br />
<b>Beginning of Sorrows</b><br />

<br />
Oh, you virus spawns me stress and dolor!<br />
You wreck our business scathingly, don’t you?<br />
Woe to us! these endless lockdowns all through—<br />
This cognizance I’m neither rich nor poor;<br />
To bounce on the online class is valor,<br />
Doubts have wrangled me, yet I must pursue<br />
These dreams I’m athirst for my life anew.<br />
Oh, you virus a poverty clamor!<br />
<br />
Life’s calm; lo and behold, you virus curse!<br />
Though no cash thus stressed me as a student;<br />
Still, I’ll burn the midnight oil and immerse,<br />
Slow to no internet is but adverse,<br />
No matter how trials whack, I’m prudent.<br />
Life’s good; lo and behold, you virus worse!<br />

<b>I Wish it's Au Revoir and Not Goodbye!</b><br />
<i>by Jose Ronnie Malayo Jr.</i><br />
<br />
This year have been a rollercoaster ride—<br />
But railways crisscross very steep crises,<br />
"Happy New Year!" the loud untruth abide;<br />
I sigh while imagining the high seas.<br />
<br />
Last Mother's Day; we have a little feast,<br />
Gather not just our presence but our love<br />
With cake and coke, that makes us full at least—<br />
Still, I recall my uncle's smile thereof.<br />
<br />
I fast and pray on the 13th of May<br />
With blueness of sky and warmth of the sun.<br />
Everything is serene, until mayday!<br />
Out of the blue, my uncle has begone.<br />
<br />
My world has come to a halt; then I wept,<br />
Tears a river flow along the hillside,<br />
Remembering the memories, we kept;<br />
Oh, alas, the grief slowly slays inside.<br />
<br />
Who would've surmised that after three days—<br />
A holiday is before someone's death,<br />
From be all smiles to sudden sob conveys;<br />
Painfully, auntie witness his last breath!<br />
<br />
Worse, my dear cousins are still overseas;<br />
My heart clutches to take heed to their cry!<br />
Uncle, may Zion bring you lasting peace.<br />
I wish it's au revoir and not goodbye!<br />
<br />
Two months went by; in the blink of an eye,<br />
Healing from the depression stage of grief,<br />
Almost normal, just like the cloudy sky<br />
But, alas, a storm beset my relief!<br />
<br />
World of mine has turned upside down again,<br />
The 31st of July has squeezed me;<br />
A friend has departed from the world, then<br />
I thought summer wail's enough already.<br />
<br />
This year's a season of grief, without doubts,<br />
Then I look back on my friend's final chats;<br />
With regrets, we could have stroll whereabouts<br />
And hear his vivacious laughter perhaps.<br />
<br />
He's a catalyst of dreams and reason,<br />
Such a death is shocking; we cried out why!<br />
But to everything, there is a season.<br />
I wish it's au revoir and not goodbye!<br />
<br />
<b>Metamorphosis</b><br />
<i>by Jose Ronnie Malayo Jr.</i><br />
<br />
I'm topsy-turvy. What am I to bring fruition?<br />
All grounds for hope has grown faint<br />
in this pandemic of Abaddon's exposition.<br />
I wanted to bust a gut, yet I'm no holy saint;<br />
many prophets cried out, "Repent, repent!"<br />
With sheer perplexity to what it truly implies,<br />
but I lend an ear to them with an open mind.<br />
Living earth is vast of the wilderness of lies;<br />
long drought for truth and so confined.<br />
<br />
If this is reality, then I bid my consciousness<br />
for what shall I forfeit if I give it a fly?<br />
People grow, and people work out progress;<br />
till the epoch that I die, I believe God hereby<br />
if He transcends universally and each mind.<br />
This chasm of subjectivity and objectivity,<br />
but with the Holy Scriptures, I intertwined.<br />
<br />
A year of bombarded trials and tribulations.<br />
I bounce back from that as a new creation<br />
like a larva, feeding myself with the Word.<br />
Then grow a hundredfold from it spurred;<br />
praying to blossom inside this chrysalis.<br />
Then perfect an enigmatic metamorphosis,<br />
flapping my colorful wings to infinite bliss.<br />`;
