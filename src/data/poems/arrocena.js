<header>Lying</header><br />

<br />
It’s loud, their voices.<br />
It’s sharp, but pointless.<br />
The walls, they’re too far –<br />
To protect yet too close to breath.<br />
It’s closed, the door -<br />
It’s open, to a closing.<br />
The ceiling, it asks me -<br />
Are you lying, or are you lying?<br />

<header>Lazy Day</header><br />
<i>by Franky Arrocena</i><br />
<br />
It’s my lazy day but --<br />
Someone’s not eating, somewhere.<br />
Someone’s lying on the stone cold ground, somewhere.<br />
Someone’s gravely parched, somewhere.<br />
Someone’s begging for dear life, somewhere.<br />
Someone’s somewhere, Someone’s somewhere.<br />
Somewhere someone’s someone is somewhere.<br />
Someone’s always got somewhere to be someone.<br />
But it’s my lazy day.<br />
<br />
<header>Man, Look Out.</header><br />
<i>by Franky Arrocena</i><br />
<br />
Man, there are times<br />
When it seems like a joke, your life.<br />
Man, those times when<br />
You can’t even believe how bad it got.<br />
Man, when you thought<br />
These things only happen in movies.<br />
Man, it’s fucked up<br />
When life just goes on around you<br />
But you’re begging it to stop<br />
Because what the fuck just happened?<br />
Man.<br />
You look at the view from halfway down<br />
Straight in the eye<br />
If it has eyes, maybe it doesn’t.<br />
But it’s looking at you.<br />
At me too.<br />
It was looking.<br />`;
